## Risks and Mitigation

* **API limitations:**  Potential rate limits or API changes could affect data acquisition.  Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and explore alternative data sources.
* **Data quality:** Inconsistent or inaccurate data could lead to flawed analysis. Mitigation:  Implement rigorous data cleaning and validation procedures.
* **Algorithm complexity:**  Developing robust algorithms requires significant effort. Mitigation:  Iterative development and testing.


##  Next Steps

Prioritize API integrations and initial data processing.
