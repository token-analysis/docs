# Cryptocurrency On-Chain Analysis System Design

## Key Metric Definitions

* **Holder Count and Concentration:** Percentage of total supply held by the top 10 holders.
* **Large Transaction Volume:** Transfers exceeding $100,000.
* **Social Media Sentiment Score:** Ratio of positive to negative sentiment.
* **Active Address Growth Rate:** Rate of increase in the number of newly active addresses.


## Data Integration and Acquisition

Real-time data acquisition will utilize the following APIs:
* **Moralis:** Retrieves holder list and holder stats for BnbChain, Eth and SOL.
* **Token Vesting:** Retrieves token Vesting information.
* **Nansen API:**  Retrieves holder distribution and smart wallet activity.
* **CryptoQuant API:** Retrieves trading volume and exchange flow data.
* **Santiment API:** Retrieves social sentiment and development activity data.

For specific data, such as social media sentiment related to a specific token (e.g., "SOL token sentiment"), the relevant API will be queried, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like VADER or TextBlob will be used for sentiment analysis.


## Analytical Logic Development

Scripts or existing tools will process the data:

* **Holder Concentration Calculation:** For example, top 10 holders owning over 50% might signal high risk.
* **Large Transaction Monitoring:** Set alerts; for example, whale sell-offs might signal a short opportunity.
* **On-chain Data and Social Sentiment Combination:** For example, positive sentiment + increased active addresses might signal a long opportunity.


## Threshold Definition

* **Short Alert Trigger:** Top holders selling off more than 5% of the supply.
* **Long Alert Trigger:** Positive social sentiment and a surge in trading volume.


## Real-time Monitoring and Alerts

* Cloud services (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) will be used for continuous data acquisition and analysis.
* Alerts will be set to notify users of on-chain events (e.g., large transfers) or significant changes in social sentiment (a marked shift in the positive/negative ratio).
* A dashboard will display real-time data and signals to facilitate user decision-making.


## Multi-Token Support

* The system design should be token-agnostic, allowing users to input token addresses or names (e.g., ERC-20 contract addresses).
* Prioritize analysis of high-volume or user-focused tokens to ensure scalability.


## Backtesting and Optimization

* Historical data will be used to backtest the analytical logic, ensuring signals align with past price movements. For example, testing whether price drops when top holders sell off, and evaluating the effectiveness of shorting strategies.
* Continuous optimization based on market feedback, such as adjusting thresholds or adding new indicators.
